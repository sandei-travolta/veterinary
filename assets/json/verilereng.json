There might be sudden death in rapidly-growing, apparently-healthy cattle or calves, with lesions of hemorrhagic enteritis often in the absence of other signs. Enterotoxemia caused by CLOSTRIDIUM PERFRINGENS type D in lambs and kids from suckling to about 1-year of age is an important disease in ovine feedlots. In goats a subacute form with diarrhea and signs of abdominal discomfort followed by recovery in 2-4 days and a chronic form with days or weeks of diarrhea and weight loss have been reported. CLOSTRIDIUM PERFRINGENS type A can cause gastrointestinal disease in lambs and kids and Yellow Lamb Disease, in which affected lambs present with hemolysis. Lamb Dysentery is caused by CLOSTRIDIUM PERFRINGENS type B. Lambs with peracute disease are usually less than 2 weeks old, with most 1-3 days of age. Slower-onset disease (Pine) has been described in 2-3-week-old lambs. Hemorrhagic Enterotoxemia due to CLOSTRIDIUM PERFRINGENS type C usually affects very young sheep and occasionally kids but has been diagnosed in feedlot lambs. Struck is CLOSTRIDIUM PERFRINGENS type C septicemia and toxemia in adult sheep; sudden death is often the only sign. Focal Symmetrical Encephalomalacia due to CLOSTRIDIUM PERFRINGENS type D toxins is characterized by areas of brain necrosis.",

Fecal-oral transmission from cows to calves is believed to be the most common method of spread; also shed in milk and colostrum. Intrauterine transmission does not appear to be of major importance. Affected cattle continue to eat even as chronic diarrhea and weight loss persist. In goats the disease primarily affects the upper GI tract and weight loss might be the only obvious sign, with diarrhea intermittent or absent. Usually affects goats 2-years-old or older but yearlings can be affected. Paratuberculosis is common in flocks of sheep but identification of individual sheep with subclinical infections is difficult.

Lymphoplasmacytic Enterocolitis is defined by infiltration of lymphocytes and plasma cells at the level of the lamina propria. Can occur at any age and there is no breed or sex predilection. Granulomatous Enteritis is defined by by lymphoid and macrophage infiltration at the level of the mucosal lamina propria with variable numbers of plasma cells and giant cells. There is marked villous atrophy of the ileum. This form of Inflammatory Bowel Disease appears to have almost disappeared. When Multisystemic Equine Eosinophilic Epitheliotropic Disease affects the gastrointestinal tract with eosinophilic and lymphocytic-plasmacytic infiltrates it is a form of Inflammatory Bowel Disease.",

Difficult to differentiate from hematomas or seromas without aspiration. Myositis can occasionally follow intramuscular injections. Subcutaneous abscesses are common in cats. Frequently located on the face, limbs, back, and base of the tail of intact males. Usual cause is a cat bite and most contain anaerobic organisms, often mixed with aerobic organisms or mycoplasma. Recurrent or prolonged infections should raise suspicions of yeast or concurrent FeLV infection. A piece of foreign material can cause chronic drainage of the tract, sometimes with alternate stages of healing and draining; wood is the agent most-commonly involved.",

Tracheal Collapse is rare in horses other than American Miniature Horses. Tracheal Stenosis can be congenital, follow trauma or necrosis from an endotracheal tube, be associated with hemorrhage and edema in the wall of the trachea ('Honker Syndrome' in cattle and pigs) or be due to pressure external to the trachea from a lesion such as an abscess or tumor. Tracheal Hypoplasia has been described in dogs; the diagnosis is usually made in young  brachycephalic dogs, sometimes in association with other anomalies.

Tearing of the transverse humoral ligament has led to medial displacement of the tendon of origin of the biceps brachii muscle in racing Greyhounds and other breeds; this has also been reported in horses. A defect of the tarsal insertion of the superficial digital flexor in horses and dogs can allow a palpable luxation of the tendon. Swelling of the calcanean bursa over the hock can develop, and the tendon can be manually displaced when the animal is standing. Lesions of the peritendinousperiligamentous soft tissues of the tarsus (plantar fasciitis) are common in horses. Nuchal crest tendon avulsion, fracture, and desmitis can affect horses. Lateral luxation of the superficial digital flexor tendon appears to be inherited as a simple autosomal trait in Shetland Sheepdogs. Gastrocnemius Tendonitis caused lameness in horses. Rupture or Avulsion of the Peroneus Tertius tendon in ruminants and horses is characterized by ability to passively extend the hock while the stifle is flexed, a maneuver usually stopped by the peroneus tertius. Affected animals will often bear weight with no pain unless the area is palpated. There can be a swinging-leg lameness. Swelling might occur over site of rupture. Agenesis of the peroneus tertius was described in a foal. ",

Silent estrus has been described in bitches and queens and is a cause of reproductive culling in swine. Queens might have heats which go unnoticed unless they are placed with a breeding male. Failure to detect estrus is a major cause of reproductive failure in hand-mated or artificially-bred animals. Concrete or other slippery surfaces and lameness suppress signs of estrus in cattle.

Stimulus-specific seizures occur in dogs; the triggers might repeatedly provoke seizures. Seizures can be followed by postictal depression or blindness. Status Epilepticus is seizure activity lasting > 5 min or > 2 discrete seizures with incomplete recovery of consciousness in between. Myopathy can accompany Status Epilepticus. Epilepsy is rare in cattle; attacks usually start when calves are several months old and might disappear entirely between 1 and 2 years of age.

Most cases are idiopathic but common causes of the pituitary form  are pituitary neoplasia, cysts, granulomas, trauma, or localized infection which result in compression of the pituitary; neurologic signs can accompany some of these lesions. Nephrogenic form has been associated with pyometra, severe hepatic disease, hyperadrenocorticism, pyelonephritis, hypokalemia,  hypoadrenocorticism, hyperthyroidism, acromegaly, renal disease, neoplasia,  and several drugs; congenital nephrogenic diabetes insipidus has been described in young dogs. Nephrogenic diabetes insipidus won't respond to exogenous ADH. Animals with Diabetes Insipidus that are unable to drink or with restricted access to water are  at risk for hypernatremia and secondary neurologic signs including coma.",

Secondary Hypoadrenocorticism due to insufficient adrenocorticotropic hormone stimulation results from hypothalamic or pituitary lesions or prolonged  exogenous glucocorticoid administration. Clinical signs of  Hypoadrenocorticism can wax and wane. Acute severe disease (adrenal crisis) might be due to adrenal infarction or termination of the chronic phase.

STAPHYLOCOCCUS PSEUDINTERMEDIUS is a common isolate. Pustular skin disease of the chin and lips, Canine Acne, is common in short-coated breeds; generally occurs in dogs from 3-12 months of age but can  persist into maturity. Superficial, generally-benign pyoderma, Impetigo, affects the ventral abdomen and/or mucocutaneous junctions of dogs less than 8-months of age; STAPHYLOCOCCUS can be isolated and healing is usually spontaneous. Skin Fold Dermatitis, Intertrigo, is caused by friction and minor trauma to the skin, poor air circulation, moisture, and glandular secretions providing an environment that favors skin maceration and bacterial growth. Bacterial Overgrowth Syndrome in dogs is characterized by skin-surface irritation and damage caused by overgrowth of staphylococci, primarily STAPHYLOCOCCUS PSEUDINTERMEDIUS; papules, pustules, epidermal collarettes, and crusts are absent. Feline Acne of the chin and lips occurs at all ages; papules and pustules can progress to folliculitis, furunculosis, and cellulitis. The cause is unknown but appears to be multifactorial.  Unweaned kittens can develop a pustular dermatitis of the back and neck, probably due to 'mouthing' by the queen; lesions might spread to the head, withers, chest and abdomen.",
